* About
This a repo to store the SSH projects my teacher taught me.

* Environment
- jdk 1.7 or jdk 1.8
- apache-tomcat-7.0.57
- MySQL
- Eclipse

To run the project I offered, you need to add tomcat lib jar files to the existing projects. Steps to do that are =Right click on your project name -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Tab **Libraries** -> Add Library -> Server Run Time -> Apache Tomcat= ã€‚

Then you should modify the MySQL password.

I only track the core code in the project so that the project cloned to your computer possiblily couldn't run.

* File Info
** Hibernate
=HibernateCRM01= just realises the addition of customer.

=HibernateCRM02= implements the customer list on the basis of HibernateCRM01

=HibernateDemo01= has some examples on how to write mapping files.

In =SpringHibernate01= , SessionFactory of Hibernate is created by Spring.

In =SpringHibernate02= , transaction in Hibernate is handed over to Spring's declarative transaction.

** SSH
=SpringCRM02= is the initial intergration of the SSH framework. Don't be fooled by it's name. It only implements add customer funtion.

Note that all the SpringDemo* are Java projects, you also need to import the all the jars in =lib= folder to the project by following =Right click on your project name -> Build Path -> Configure Build Path -> Tab **Libraries** -> Add JARs -> Choose all the jars in your project's lib folder=

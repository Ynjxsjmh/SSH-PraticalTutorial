* About
This a repo to store the SSH projects my teacher taught me.

* Environment
- jdk 1.7 or jdk 1.8
- apache-tomcat-7.0.57
- MySQL
- Eclipse

To run the project I offered, you need to add tomcat lib jar files to the existing projects.

Then you should modify the MySQL password.

I only track the core code in the project so that the project cloned to your computer possiblily couldn't run.

* File Info
=HibernateCRM01= just realises the addition of customer.

=HibernateCRM02= implements the customer list on the basis of HibernateCRM01

=Struts2SimplestDemo= is just a project with pure Struts2. If you understand this demo, you can grasp half of the knowledge of Struts2.
